Large language models are neural networks trained on vast amounts of text data.
They learn to predict the next token in a sequence by analyzing patterns and relationships.
Temperature is a hyperparameter that controls the randomness of text generation.
Lower temperatures make the model more deterministic and focused on high-probability tokens.
Higher temperatures increase diversity but may produce less coherent outputs.
Tokenization is the process of breaking text into smaller units called tokens.
These tokens can be words, subwords, or characters depending on the tokenizer design.
Word embeddings represent tokens as dense vectors in a continuous space.
Similar words have similar embeddings, enabling semantic reasoning and comparison.
The softmax function converts model outputs into probability distributions.
Attention mechanisms allow models to weigh the importance of different input tokens.
This selective focus enables better understanding of context and long-range dependencies.
